'''
This is a Unit Test for Rule CheckRootPath

@author: ekkehard j. koch
@change: 03/18/2013 ekkehard Original Implementation
@change: 04/21/2013 ekkehard Renamed from SecureRootPath to CheckRootPath
@change: 2016/02/10 roy Added sys.path.append for being able to unit test this
                        file as well as with the test harness.
