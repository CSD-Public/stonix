reate stonixsign.conf with the following content:
 
[ req ]
distinguished_name = req_name
prompt = no
[ req_name ]
CN = stonix-test
[ extensions ]
basicConstraints=critical,CA:false
keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature
extendedKeyUsage=critical,1.2.840.113635.100.4.13
1.2.840.113635.100.6.1.14=critical,DER:0500
 
 
2. Generate the key:
 
openssl genrsa -out stonixsign.key  2048
 
3. Create the self-signed certificate:
 
openssl req -x509 -new -config stonixsign.conf -nodes \
-key stonixsign.key -extensions extensions -sha256 -out stonixsign.crt
 
4. Create a keychain:
 
security create-keychain stonix-test
 
5. Import the cert into the keychain, only valid for the current user:
 
security add-trusted-cert -u -1 -k stonix-test stonixsign.crt
 
6. Now you should be able to use the "build.py" script for the Jenkins user.
 
To build stonix with the new credentials and keychain:
 
sudo ./build.py -d -s "stonix-test" --keychain /Users/<username>/Library/Keychains/stonix-test
 
#####
 
To use on Mac systems other than the build machine, as long as the User is the same, you should just be able to copy the ~/Library/Keychains/stonix-test.keychain on the build machine to the same user folder, same location, then you should be able to run stonix on that machine.  Keychain might need to be unlocked for that to work.  rTthe ./ramdisk/lib/manage_keychain library might be useful for unlocking the keychain..
