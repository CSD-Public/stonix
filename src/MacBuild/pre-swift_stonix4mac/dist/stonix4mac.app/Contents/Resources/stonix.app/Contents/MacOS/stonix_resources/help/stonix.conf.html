<h1>stonix.conf</h1>
<p>
The /etc/stonix.conf configuration file (/private/etc/stonix.conf on Apple OS X)
holds all of the custom configuration changes made to STONIX. This consists of
<a href="gui.html#CI">configuration items</a> (CIs) and user comments. 
<p>
The file may be blank, in which case default values for all CIs are used. When
a change is saved, the stonix.conf file is populated with each rule's name and
help text, but not with the default CI values (only those that have been changed).
To create a fully-populated stonix.conf file, execute <code>stonix -cP</code>
at the command line (a minimally-populated stonix.conf can be generated by executing 
<code>stonix -cp</code>). This can be very helpful for users who are running
STONIX exclusively at the command line, and do not have access to the <a href="gui.html">GUI</a> for
viewing and changing configuration items.
<p>
The format for setting a rule's CI(s) is as follows:<br>
<pre><code>[RuleName]
CINAME = civalue
UCCINAME = User comment text goes here.\nIf edited directly, use "\n" for new lines.</code></pre>
The rule name is in square brackets. The CI name is on a single line with its
value, separated by "open equals" (an equal sign with a space on both sides).
The next line is the user comment for that CI, which is named with the capital
letters "UC" followed by the CI name.<br>
<br>
For a specific example, we can take a look at the ConfigureAIDE rule, which has a
boolean CI, as well as a text string:<br>
<pre><code>[ConfigureAIDE]
configureaide = True
UCconfigureaide =
AIDEJobTime = 05 04 * * *
UCAIDEJobTime =</code></pre>
CIs can take several different data types, but the most common is boolean (True/False).
These CIs appear as checkboxes in the GUI. To set the value of a boolean CI,
simply set <code>CINAME = True</code> or <code>CINAME = False</code>. For most
other CIs, the description will give information on the appropriate input. Note
that validation will not occur if the stonix.conf file is edited directly, which
can cause STONIX to become unstable or fail to run. It is therefore recommended
that changes be made in the GUI when possible, where the changes can be
validated for the proper data type.
