Created on Mar 9, 2016

@author: dwalker
@change: 08/03/2018 - dwalker - added more documentation and fixed
        regex check to look for = with spaces around it inside
        checkSimple method and removed unecessary else portion of code
        inside validate method.
@changed: 08/15/2018 - Brandon R. Gonzales - changed a regular expression from
        "*:" to ".*:"
@changed: 12/18/2019 - dwalker - Updated class to handle a new type of data
    dictionary.
